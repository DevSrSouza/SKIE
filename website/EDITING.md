Open VSCode.



### Edit Code

The home page is at `src/pages/index.tsx`. That is technically React code, but it is mostly just layout tags.

The components in the index page all live in `src/components`. Open `Overview.jsx`. Change some of the coty text, then
save the file. The content running in the browser should update in a second or two.

That's basically it. Play with it. You won't break anything, at least not on the server. Worst case, just get the code again.
