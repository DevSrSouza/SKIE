### Edit Code

The home page is at `website/src/pages/index.tsx`. That is technically React code, but it is mostly just layout tags.

The components in the index page all live in `website/src/components`.

That's basically it. Play with it. You won't break anything, at least not on the server. Worst case, just get the code again.
