# Installation

Installing SKIE involves small additions to just two gradle files. The Swift/Xcode side does not require any configuration changes.

Kotlin compiler plugins are generally not stable and break with almost every release, so please make sure that your project uses exactly the same Kotlin compiler version as SKIE (1.7.20) and Gradle 7.3 or higher.

**Before you do anything else, check that your project compiles (especially if you had to change Gradle and/or Kotlin versions).**

Add the following to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("co.touchlab.faktory.access").version("{{TOUCHLAB_ACCESS_VERSION}}")
}
```

SKIE is deployed in a private Touchlab Maven repository. To access artifacts from that repository, you will need an API key from Touchlab.

:::info

You should have a key to access SKIE, but if not, [reach out](https://touchlab.co/contact-us/).

:::

You API key should have been sent through email. Once you have your API key, you will then need to add the following code in `gradle.properties`:

<ApiKeyInterpolatedCodeBlock
    language="properties"
    title="gradle.properties">
{`touchlab.key={API_KEY}`}
</ApiKeyInterpolatedCodeBlock>

With those values set, you should be able to access our private maven repo and binaries.

To enable SKIE, add the plugin in `build.gradle.kts` of the module that builds the native framework:

```kotlin title=build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("co.touchlab.skie") version "{{LATEST_GITHUB_VERSION}}"
}
```

SKIE should only be applied to modules that export your Xcode Frameworks. It automatically works on dependent project modules and 3rd party dependencies.

That is the totality of what's required to integrate SKIE! Below is a list of features that SKIE supports. If you find that you want or need to customize SKIE's behavior, then check out the [Configuration doc](/docs/Configuration/Configuration.md).
