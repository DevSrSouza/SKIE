# Installation

Installing SKIE involves small additions to just two gradle files. The Swift/Xcode side does not require any configuration changes.

First, make sure that your project uses Kotlin version supported by SKIE.
SKIE with version `0.4.3` and newer supports Kotlin 1.8.0 and 1.8.10.
To use SKIE with Kotlin 1.8.20, add suffix "-preview.1.8.20" to the base version (for example: `0.4.3-preview.1.8.20`).

Additionally, all SKIE versions require Gradle 7.3 or newer.

**Before you do anything else, check that your project compiles (especially if you had to change Gradle and/or Kotlin versions).**

Add the following to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
        // Add only if you need it for other plugins
        // google()
    }
}

plugins {
    id("co.touchlab.faktory.access").version("{{TOUCHLAB_ACCESS_VERSION}}")
}
```

SKIE is deployed in a private Touchlab Maven repository. To access artifacts from that repository, you will need an API key from Touchlab.

:::info

You should have a key to access SKIE, but if not, [reach out](https://touchlab.co/contact-us/).

:::

Your API key should have been sent through email. Once you have your API key, you will then need to add the following code in `gradle.properties`:

<ApiKeyInterpolatedCodeBlock
    language="properties"
    title="gradle.properties">
{`touchlab.key={API_KEY}`}
</ApiKeyInterpolatedCodeBlock>

With those values set, you should be able to access our private maven repo and binaries.

To enable SKIE, add the plugin in `build.gradle.kts` of the module that builds the native framework:

```kotlin title=build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("co.touchlab.skie") version "{{LATEST_GITHUB_VERSION}}"
}
```

SKIE should only be applied to modules that export your Xcode Frameworks. It automatically works on dependent project modules and 3rd party dependencies.

That is the totality of what's required to integrate SKIE! You can read more about SKIE, and the features it supports, in [SKIE Intro](/docs/intro.md). If you find that you want or need to customize SKIE's behavior, then check out the [Configuration doc](/docs/Configuration/Configuration.md).
