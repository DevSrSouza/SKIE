# SKIE

![SKIE](skie-header.jpg)

Skie is a compiler plugin that generates Swift wrappers of the Objective-C headers generated by the Kotlin compiler. Its goal is to improve interoperability between Kotlin and Swift by recreating features supported by both languages, but lost in the translation from Kotlin to Objective-C to Swift.

See [the documentation website](https://skie.touchlab.co/intro) for more info.

## Acknowledgements

The Kotlin compiler plugin module uses SwiftPoet from Outfox, Inc. to generate Swift code. Due to some changes we had to do, we included the source code in `SKIE/compiler/kotlin-plugin/src/kgp_common/kotlin/io/outfoxx/swiftpoet`.
